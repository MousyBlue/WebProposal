			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			  <p>
          Before diving into the construction of the website, a moment was taken to consider the information put forward in the previously submitted <a href="https://webproposal.mousyblue.repl.co/">web preposal</a>. This document detailed the background research and potential designs of the website, and acted as an important guide when developing the functioning version. By synthesising the research conducted, as well as accounting for given feedback, the following list of design guidelines was created. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Remember target users.</strong> A large majority of the predicted users are expected to come from an older demographic. This demographic can find troubles in overly complex or intricate website designs, and prefer information to be straightforward and easy to understand. Keeping their needs in mind, the website should;
            <ul>
              <li>Make navigation choices / selections obvious (eg colour and cursor changes)</li>
              <li>Have accessable text, both with size and colour contrasts</li>
              <li>Be descriptive and clear when requiring action (eg in forms and button lables)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Provide room for important infomation.</strong> The information hierarchy was developed based on the <a href"https://web.archive.org/web/20200827032410/http://www.actwildlife.net/index.html">old ACT Wildlife homepage</a>, which had a lot of information deemed unneccessary. Much of this was removed or relocated in the design preposal, as it was considered important not to overload users. Still, care should be taken to ensure the neccessary information is still easily available.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>An interesting aside:</strong> By very weird coincidence, the ACT Wildlife webpage was completely updated early on in the development of this web prototype. The site is overall much nicer than it was, however, there are still several elements that would require fixing. I am not going to do a full review of the current webpage as I did for the previous one, but I would like to point out that the new website prioritises the same 4 pages that I chose to develop in my prototype (Home, Get Involved, About, and Wildlife Tips). Did they copy me? Definitely not but this provides confirmation that these pages are considered most important to the website. See ACT Wildlifes shiny new site <a href="https://actwildlife.net/">here</a>.</p>

    <!------------------------ DEVELOPENT --------------------------->
		<section id="development">
			<h2>Development</h2>
      <p>This section details the development of each page of the web prototype. It should be noted that the pages were developed in tandem, not one at a time as presented. This means git commits will not necessarily show the changes in this exact order, however, it was determined to be easier to showcase the iterations of page development when ordered in this way.</p>
      <p>During the development stage, designs were almost exclusively based of those presented in the web preposal, particularly the wireframes and mockups. The provided a starting point and aim for the development of the code, which could then be tested and adjusted.</p>
      <h3 id="home">Home Page</h3>
      <p>The home or index page was the first to begin construction, as this was considered the most important, being the first that the user would see. It also contained elements used in other pages, such as the navigation bar, footer, and banner.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home1.jpg" alt="First design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>The page layout was established first, with colours being taken from the mockup. Information was yet to be added.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home2.jpg" alt="Second design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>More information was added, and an extra grid placed in the footer. Scale was not right for different window sizes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home3.jpg" alt="Third design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>The box margins were adjusted to better fit the window sizes, and more styling was done. Large buttons were added to the events table to make it obvious where to sign up.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home4.jpg" alt="Fourth design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>Grid added to the banner and more aesthetic changes made.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home5.jpg" alt="Fifth design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>Mediaquery adeded to change the page layout for smaller screens, so the boxes to not have to shrink. Nav bar does not change at this stage.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home6.jpg" alt="Sixth design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>Collapsable nav bar developed that is only shown on narrower screens. A collapsable nav bar was chosen as it needed to remain large, but not get in the way of the content.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/home7.jpg" alt="7th design of homepage"/>
          <figcaption>Echidna logo added to fill blank space and small aesthetic changes made. At this stage, it looks very similar to the mockup, with the most major change being the formatting of the events table.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="getInvolved">Get Involved Page</h3>
      <p>The "get involved" page was considered to be important as it provides a call to action for the user (volunteer with the charity!) as well as a means to achieve that (a form to fill out). The design of the form is also able to be used a base for other parts of the site that might require forms, such as signing up for events or donating.</p>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/getinvolved1.jpg" alt="First design of get involved page"/>
          <figcaption>The basic information was added to the page, including the form with its input fields. The navigation bar and footer was copied directly from the index page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/getinvolved2.jpg" alt="Second design of get involved page"/>
          <figcaption>Form was form-atted and the size of the text boxes expanded to match the expected inputs.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/getinvolved3.jpg" alt="Third design of get involved page"/>
          <figcaption>The radio buttons and checkboxes were placed inside a table to keep them inline.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
				  <img src="website images/getinvolved4.JPG" alt="Fourth design of get involved page"/>
          <figcaption>Javascript was added to make additional text boxes pop up only when certain buttons were selected.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="tips">Wildlife Tips Page</h3>
      <p>This page was designed to be navigated to if the user had found an animal and wanted to know how to help. Thus the page provides direct instructions on how help said animal, as well as additional information should they wish to know more.</p>
      <figure>
          <img src="website images/wildlifehelp1.jpg" alt="First Wildlife Help page">
          <figcaption>Information was added, formatting was all over the place</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
          <img src="website images/wildlifehelp2.jpg" alt="Second Wildlife Help page">
          <figcaption>Formatting fixed and buttons added to make the segments appear or disappear, thus not overwhelming the user with too much extra information.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="about">About Page</h3>
      <p>This page gives information about the charity, including its aims and the current project they are working on, providing a concice overview of what ACT Wildlife does. It was not included in the mockups or wireframes, but was considered important due to the information contained. With no firm layout in mind, it was desgined with a similar structure to the index page.</p>
      <figure>
          <img src="website images/about1.jpg" alt="About Page">
          <figcaption>Organisation Identity and Projects in separate boxes, with animal pictures to show the cute benifactors of their service.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <!---------------------- FINAL DESIGN -------------------------->
    <section id="final">
			<h2>Final Design</h2>
      <p>The final design for the website is shown below. Empty pages were added as a filler for additional links on the nav bar, so full functionality can be emulated.</p>
      <p>As this window is smaller than the designated "narrow" width, the page is seen in its narrow form. To view the full page, <a href="https://ACT-Wildlife-Webpage.mousyblue.repl.co">click here</a>.</p>
